- **Job**: The type of job the client has, such as management, technician, entrepreneur, or blue-collar. Job type often reflects income stability and financial behavior.
- **Duration**: The duration of the last contact with the client in seconds. Generally, longer durations indicate higher engagement and interest from the client.
- **Poutcome**: The outcome of the previous marketing campaign, if any. Possible values include:
    - **Success**: The client subscribed in a previous campaign.
    - **Failure**: The client was contacted but did not subscribe.
    - **Unknown**: There was no information from a previous campaign.

    - **balance**: Average yearly balance in euros in the client‚Äôs bank account.
    - **housing**: Whether the client has a housing loan (`yes` or `no`).
    - **contact**: Type of communication used to contact the client (e.g., cellular, telephone, unknown).
    - **day**: Day of the month when the client was last contacted.
    - **month**: Month of last contact (e.g., jan, feb, mar).
    - **duration**: Duration of the last contact in seconds. Longer durations generally indicate higher engagement.
    - **campaign**: Number of contacts performed during this campaign for this client.
    - **pdays**: Number of days since the client was last contacted in a previous campaign. `-1` indicates no prior contact.
    - **previous**: Number of contacts performed before this campaign for this client.
